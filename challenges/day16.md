# Day 16: The Festival Countdown App ⏰❄️

## Welcome Back, AI Engineer

The Winter Festival is such a hit that people are already asking: "When's the next one?!"

The Festival Director wants a simple, beautiful countdown app that shows:
- Days, hours, minutes, seconds until next year's festival
- A winter-themed design
- Fun facts about the festival that rotate
- A "notify me" email signup

**Your mission:** Build a countdown app using `.goosehints` combined with one or more planning approaches of your choice.

## 🎯 The Challenge

**Previous days:** You chatted with goose and built things organically

**Today:** You'll structure the project FIRST, then let goose execute

### Two Parts:

1. **`.goosehints`** - Tells goose HOW to work (conventions, tech stack, style)
2. **A planning approach** - Tells goose WHAT to build

### Choose One or More Planning Approaches:

| Approach | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| [`/plan` command](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/creating-plans/) | Interactive collaboration |
| [TODO Extension](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/mcp/todo-mcp/) | Step-by-step progress tracking |
| [`goose run -i INSTRUCTIONS.md`](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/running-tasks/) | Automated/repeatable builds |

## 📋 Your Task

### Step 1: Create Your `.goosehints`

Look at the `.goosehints` file in the goose repo you're in for inspiration. Then create your own for the countdown app.

📚 [Using .goosehints Guide](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/using-goosehints/)

### Step 2: Choose & Use a Planning Approach

Pick one or more from the table above, read the docs, and use it to build your app.

### Step 3: Build the App

Let goose execute your plan and build:
- ⏰ Countdown to December 1, 2026, 10:00 AM
- 💡 Rotating fun facts
- ✉️ Email signup form
- ❄️ Winter-themed design
- 📱 Mobile-responsive

### Fun Facts You Can Use:
- "Last year's festival had 5,000 visitors!"
- "We served 2,000 cups of hot cocoa!"
- "The ice sculpture took 12 hours to carve!"
- "50 volunteers made this festival possible!"
- "The yeti mascot won by popular vote!"
