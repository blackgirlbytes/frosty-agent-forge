# Day 13: The Festival Staff Scheduling Crisis 📅⚡

**Welcome Back, AI Engineer**

Marcus is having the worst day of his festival career. Staff members keep walking up to him saying things like:

*"Hey Marcus, I can work Monday and Tuesday mornings, but I need Wednesday off for my dentist appointment..."*

*"Marcus! I'm available all three days but I can't do the photo booth - I don't know how it works..."*

*"Can you put me down for security? I'm free 6 AM to 6 PM Monday through Wednesday, but I really prefer morning shifts..."*

Marcus is frantically scribbling notes on whatever he can find - napkins, receipts, the back of his hand. The Festival Director walks by and sees the chaos:

*"Marcus, people need to know when and where to show up! We can't run a festival with napkin schedules!"*

Marcus looks at his pile of random notes and sighs: *"I have all this information scattered everywhere, but I don't even know how to organize it into something useful..."*

That's where `@goose` terminal integration comes in.

## 🎯 Your Mission: Help Marcus Build a Real Scheduling System

**What You Need to Do:**
1. Set up `@goose` terminal integration  
2. Help Marcus organize all the scattered availability information
3. Use `@goose` to guide you through building a proper scheduling system
4. Create something the whole festival team can actually use

**The Challenge:** Use `@goose` in your terminal to transform Marcus's scattered notes into a working staff scheduling website - step by step, with AI guidance.

## 📋 Marcus's Scattered Notes

Marcus hands you his collection of scribbled information. Help him by creating this file: `staff_notes.txt`

```
Marcus Thompson - security guy - told me he's free Mon-Wed 6am-6pm, likes mornings better
Elena from marketing - she said Tue-Thu 9am-9pm works, but absolutely no weekends
Sarah Chen our coordinator - available every day 8am-8pm, just needs lunch break
David the tech guy - Mon-Wed 10am-10pm, he's the only one who knows the photo booth
Lisa new volunteer - Wed-Fri 12pm-8pm, she'll need someone to train her
Tom setup crew - Sun-Tue 5am-3pm, he's the strong guy for heavy stuff  
Emma first aid - available all week 9am-5pm, festival requires her at every event
Jake sound tech - Mon-Wed 7am-11pm, but he only does main stage work
```

## 🛠️ Getting Started

**Requirements:**
- **goose CLI version 1.16.1 or later** (check with `goose --version`)
- Use the **goose CLI** for this challenge (not Desktop)

Follow the [goose Terminal Integration Guide](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/terminal-integration/) to set up `@goose` in your terminal, then start helping Marcus organize his scheduling chaos!

## 🪄 The Magic of Terminal Integration

Here's what makes `@goose` different from `goose run` - **it sees your terminal history**.

**Try this:**
```bash
# First, look at the file
cat staff_notes.txt

# Now ask goose - don't mention the file name!
@goose "who here can work Wednesday?"
```

Notice you didn't have to say "in staff_notes.txt" - goose already saw you looking at it!

## 🎯 What You'll Help Marcus Build

By the end, Marcus will have:
- **Organized staff information** (who can work when and where)
- **Clear scheduling conflicts identified** (problems spotted before they happen)  
- **Complete 3-day festival schedule** (everyone knows their assignments)
- **Professional scheduling website** (no more napkin schedules!)
