# **Day 2: The Storyteller's Booth 🎪📖**

## **Welcome Back, AI Engineer**

The Winter Festival's Storyteller has laryngitis\! 

The Festival organizers are in a panic. They need an interactive experience where visitors can create personalized choose-your-own-adventure stories.

That's where you come in.

### **Your Task:**

Build a choose-your-own-adventure web app with branching story paths, user choices, and beautiful winter styling. Use goose to create the application.

**Use the ACCESS CODE: `ADVENTDAY2`**

**⚠️ You'll need:**

* **goose (the CLI or Desktop)**  
* **Developer extension enabled** (it's enabled by default)

### **Requirements:**

1. **Story with at least 3 choice points** (branching paths)  
2. **Multiple possible endings** (at least 2\)  
3. **Winter-themed styling** (must look festive and magical)  
4. **Navigation between story segments** based on user choices  
5. **Working file** that runs in a browser

### **Example Output:**

A single-page web app that might look like:

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║        ❄️ THE WINTER FOREST TALE ❄️          ║
╠═══════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║                                               ║
║  You stand at the edge of an enchanted       ║
║  winter forest. Snowflakes dance in the      ║
║  moonlight, and two paths lie before you.    ║
║                                               ║
║  [🌲 Take the forest path]                   ║
║  [🏔️ Climb the mountain trail]               ║
║                                               ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

## **🛠️ The Tool: Developer Extension**

The developer extension is your AI coding companion \- it's **enabled by default** in goose and gives you powerful capabilities:

**Key Tools:**

* **text_editor**: Create, view, and edit files (supports view, write, str\_replace, insert, undo\_edit)  
* **shell**: Execute commands in your terminal  
* **analyze**: Understand code structure and relationships  
* **screen_capture**: Take screenshots for visual debugging  
* **image_processor**: Process and work with images

**For this challenge**, you'll primarily see goose use **text\_editor** to create your files. Watch in the UI as goose uses these tools \- it's completely transparent about what it's doing\!

**Three approaches you can take:**

1. **One-shot prompt**: Describe everything you want in one detailed prompt  
2. **Iterative**: Start simple, then refine through conversation (recommended for learning\!)  
3. **Plan:** Have goose create a plan before executing\!
