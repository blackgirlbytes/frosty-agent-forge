# Day 2: The Storyteller's Booth 🎪📖

## Welcome, AI Engineer

The Festival's beloved Storyteller has lost their voice, and the interactive storytelling booth needs to open *now*. You need to build a digital experience that captures the magic of choose-your-own-adventure stories.

As an AI engineer, you know that **conversational development** with goose Desktop is the fastest way to prototype and iterate on applications. No memorizing syntax, no fighting with documentation - just describe what you want and refine through conversation.

**Today's lesson:** Conversational development with goose Desktop

---

## 🎯 Your Task

Build a choose-your-own-adventure web app with branching story paths, user choices, and beautiful winter styling. Use goose Desktop's conversational interface to create the application.

⚠️ **You'll need:** goose Desktop (not CLI) with Developer extension enabled (it's enabled by default)

### Requirements
- Story with at least 3 choice points (branching paths)
- Multiple possible endings (at least 2)
- Winter-themed styling (must look festive and magical)
- Navigation between story segments based on user choices
- Working file that runs in a browser

### Example Output
A single-page web app that might look like:

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║        ❄️ THE WINTER FOREST TALE ❄️          ║
╠═══════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║                                               ║
║  You stand at the edge of an enchanted       ║
║  winter forest. Snowflakes dance in the      ║
║  moonlight, and two paths lie before you.    ║
║                                               ║
║  [🌲 Take the forest path]                   ║
║  [🏔️ Climb the mountain trail]               ║
║                                               ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

- Include character stats or inventory system
- Add a restart button
- Include winter-themed emoji or ASCII art in the story
- Add background music or sound effects

**Intermediate:**
- Save progress with localStorage (persist between sessions)
- Create an achievement system
- Make it mobile-responsive
- Add a story path visualization (show where you've been)
- Include images or CSS animations

**Advanced:**

## 📤 Share Your Work

**📮 Required:** Submit your work to complete Day 2!

Post your solution in the [Advent of AI Discussion](https://github.com/block/goose/discussions/categories/advent-of-ai) under **Day 2**.

**Accepted formats:**
- Screenshot of your story app in action
- Screen recording showing different story paths
- Link to a social media post (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Bluesky)
- Link to a blog post about your solution

**What to include:**
- Your favorite story path or ending
- What surprised you most about conversational development
- Any bonus challenges you completed

---

## 📖 Resources for AI Engineers

**Essential Reading:**
- [goose Documentation](https://block.github.io/goose/) - Complete reference
- [Developer Extension Docs](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/mcp/developer-mcp) - Understanding the tools
- [Using Extensions](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/getting-started/using-extensions) - How extensions work
- [goose Desktop Installation](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/getting-started/installation) - Get set up

**Key Concepts:**
- The developer extension uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) - the same architecture you'll explore more in Day 3
- Each tool use is visible in the UI - watch and learn from what goose does
- You can interrupt and redirect at any time - it's a conversation, not a script

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

You'll know you've completed Day 2 when you have a working choose-your-own-adventure web app with multiple story paths and endings, built through conversation with goose Desktop.
