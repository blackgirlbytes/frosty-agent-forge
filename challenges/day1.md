# Day 1: The Fortune Teller's Tent ⛄️

## Welcome, AI Engineer

The Winter Festival opened this morning, and already there's trouble at Madame Zelda's Fortune Telling Tent. Her mystical crystal ball (actually a fancy iPad app) crashed during the opening ceremony, and she has a line of 50 people waiting for their winter fortunes.

Madame Zelda is panicking. The festival organizers are panicking. But you? You have goose.

### Your mission 

Use goose's CLI to generate winter fortunes with different mystical personalities. Madame Zelda needs them fast, and she needs them good. The festival's reputation depends on it.

⚠️ **You'll need:** The goose CLI (not Desktop)

### Requirements
- Generate at least 3 fortunes with different moods (grumpy, poetic, festive, sarcastic, mysterious)
- Make them visually appealing - Use ASCII art, emojis, borders
- Give them a theme - Ex: seasonal and magical
