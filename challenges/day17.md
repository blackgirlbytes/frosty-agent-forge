# **🎄 Day 17: The Winter Wishlist App**

## **📖 The Story**

It's the final night of the Winter Festival, and there's one last magical tradition to bring to life.

In the center of the festival stands an ancient, frost-covered mailbox known as the Winter Fairy's Wishbox. For generations, children (and let's be honest, adults too) have written their wishes on paper and dropped them in, hoping the Winter Fairy would see them.

But this year, the Festival Director wants to modernize the magic. Instead of paper wishes that get lost or soggy, she wants a digital wishlist that appears beautifully right inside goose \- like magic appearing in the conversation\!

"Imagine," she says, eyes sparkling, someone sends their wish to goose \- just type what your heart desires \- and poof \- it appears in a beautiful, enchanted list."\!

This is your final challenge: Build the Winter Fairy's digital wishbox using MCP UI \- a way to render beautiful visual interfaces directly inside the chat.

## **📋 Requirements**

### **Core Challenge: Build the Wishlist App**

Create an MCP-UI server that renders a magical wishlist UI directly in goose.

1. **Make a Wish** 🌟

   * Tell goose something like: *"I wish for warm mittens"* or *"Add 'snow on Christmas' to my wishbox"*  
   * Each wish has: the wish itself, category (toy/experience/kindness/magic), and how much they want it (dream wish/hopeful wish/small wish)  
   * The updated wishbox UI appears showing your new wish\!

2. **View Your Wishes** ✨

   * Ask goose: *"Show me my wishes"* or *"What's in my wishbox?"*  
   * A beautiful, magical UI renders displaying all your wishes  
   * Wishes are styled by how much you want them (dream wishes glow brighter\!)

3. **Grant a Wish** 🧚

   * Tell goose: *"My mittens wish came true\!"* or *"Grant the snow wish"*  
   * The UI re-renders with that wish sparkling as granted ✨

4. **Release a Wish** 🍃  
5.   
   * Tell goose: *"Remove the mittens wish"* or *"Let go of my first wish"*  
   * The wishbox UI updates without that wish

6. **Works in goose** 🪿  
   * Your MCP server runs locally  
   * Every time you talk to goose about your wishes, the UI magically appears
