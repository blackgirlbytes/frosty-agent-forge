# **Day 4: The Festival Website Launch 🌐❄️**

The Winter Festival has been a HUGE success thanks to your help. Word spread fast about the fortune teller, the storytelling booth, and those incredible championship visualizations.

Now there's a problem of a different kind: **opportunity**.

The Festival Director just got off the phone with the Mayor. They want to make this an **annual tradition**, and they need a website to promote next year's festival. They want to launch it *today* while the buzz is still hot.

Budget remaining: **$0** (they spent it all on hot cocoa supplies).

That's where you come in.
