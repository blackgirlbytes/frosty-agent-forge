# Day 4: The Festival Website Launch 🌐❄️

## The Crisis

The festival director just realized they need a website to promote next year's Winter Festival! They have zero budget, need it launched TODAY, and want email signups to build their audience. The marketing team is panicking because they promised the mayor it would be live by tonight.

## Your Mission

Build and deploy a complete festival website using goose with multiple extensions. The site needs:

- Beautiful winter/festival themed design
- Email signup functionality
- Information about the festival
- Mobile responsive
- Deployed to production (actually live on the internet!)

## What You'll Learn

- **Multi-Extension Workflows**: Orchestrating developer + deployment extensions
- **End-to-End Shipping**: From idea to live production
- **Deployment**: Using Vercel or Netlify extensions
- **Real-World Projects**: Building something people can actually use

## Success Criteria

✅ Website is visually appealing with winter theme  
✅ Email signup form works  
✅ Site is deployed and accessible via URL  
✅ Mobile responsive design  
✅ Loads quickly  

## Bonus Challenges

⭐ **Beginner**: Add a countdown timer to next year's festival  
⭐⭐ **Intermediate**: Include a photo gallery from this year  
⭐⭐⭐ **Advanced**: Add a blog section for festival updates  
⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Ultimate**: Integrate with a CMS for easy content updates  

## Getting Started

Use goose with multiple extensions:

```bash
# Make sure you have the deployment extension installed
goose extension add vercel
# or
goose extension add netlify

# Start building
goose session start "Build and deploy a winter festival website"
```

Then describe what you want and let goose orchestrate the extensions!
