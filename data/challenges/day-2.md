# Day 2: The Storyteller's Booth 🎪📖

## The Crisis

The festival's beloved storyteller has lost their voice to laryngitis, but the interactive storytelling booth is supposed to open in an hour! Fifty excited children are already lining up outside, and their parents are getting restless.

## Your Mission

Build a choose-your-own-adventure web app that brings the storyteller's magic to life. The app should:

- Present an engaging winter-themed story
- Offer meaningful choices that affect the narrative
- Include multiple possible endings
- Feature festive winter styling
- Work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile

## What You'll Learn

- **Conversational Development**: Build a complete application through natural conversation with goose
- **Developer Extension**: Watch goose use tools transparently (file creation, shell commands)
- **Interactive UIs**: Create engaging user experiences with branching logic
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Go from idea to working app in minutes

## Success Criteria

✅ Story has at least 3 decision points  
✅ Multiple endings are possible  
✅ Winter/festival theme is evident  
✅ Works on mobile devices  
✅ Children can navigate it independently  

## Bonus Challenges

⭐ **Beginner**: Add sound effects or background music  
⭐⭐ **Intermediate**: Include illustrations or emoji art  
⭐⭐⭐ **Advanced**: Add a "story replay" feature with different choices highlighted  
⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Ultimate**: Create a story generator that creates new adventures each time  

## Getting Started

Use goose Desktop to conversationally build your app:

```bash
goose session start "Build a choose-your-own-adventure story app"
```

Then describe what you want to build and let goose guide you through the process!

## Share Your Solution

When you complete the challenge, share your creation:
- Screenshot of your app
- Link to your code (if public)
- What you learned
- Use #AdventOfAI

Good luck, and may your stories bring joy to the festival! 🎄✨
