# Day 1: The Fortune Teller's Tent 🔮

## The Crisis

Madame Zelda's fortune-telling app has crashed spectacularly, and there are 50 eager festival-goers lined up outside her tent! The app was supposed to generate personalized winter fortunes, but now it's completely dead. The line is getting restless, and people are starting to leave.

## Your Mission

Use goose CLI to rapidly prototype a fortune-telling system that can generate unique winter fortunes with different personalities. The system needs to:

- Generate fortunes on demand
- Support different fortune-teller personalities (grumpy, poetic, festive)
- Include winter/festival themes
- Work immediately from the command line

## What You'll Learn

- **CLI Automation**: Using `goose run` for rapid prototyping
- **One-off Tasks**: Solving immediate problems with AI
- **Command-line Tools**: Building quick solutions without full applications
- **Rapid Development**: Going from problem to solution in minutes

## Success Criteria

✅ Can generate fortunes from command line  
✅ Multiple personality styles work  
✅ Winter/festival themes are present  
✅ Each fortune feels unique  
✅ Fast enough to serve 50 people quickly  

## Bonus Challenges

⭐ **Beginner**: Add lucky numbers to each fortune  
⭐⭐ **Intermediate**: Include fortune categories (love, career, adventure)  
⭐⭐⭐ **Advanced**: Save fortunes to a file with timestamps  
⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Ultimate**: Create a web interface that calls the CLI tool  

## Getting Started

Use goose CLI to build your fortune generator:

```bash
